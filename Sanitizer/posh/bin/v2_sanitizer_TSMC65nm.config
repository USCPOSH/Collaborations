//This configuration file instructs the USC Netlist Sanitizer what information in the original netlist it keeps, 
//what it removes, and what it modifies. Please review and update this file before you use the sanitizer. 
//Please take the following steps to ensure that all proprietary information is removed from the netlist 
//that is output by the sanitizer.
//1) Find every device name in the technology you are using. You can do this by reviewing the PDK files. 
//Alternatively, you may load the PDK into a schematic capture tool (e.g., Cadence Virtuoso) and see the 
//list of all possible devices the technology provides, including all possible types of transistors, capacitors, 
//resistors, and so on.
//2) For every type of device you identify above, create a list of user-specified parameter names, i.e., the 
//names of parameters whose values are provided by the circuit designer. You can do this by loading the 
//PDK into a schematic capture tool (e.g., Cadence Virtuoso), adding an instance of each device type, and 
//noting the names of parameters whose values you are allowed to specify. Alternatively, you can review 
//the PDK files where, for each type of device, you can note the names of parameters whose values are 
//not expressed using algebraic expressions.
//3) For every device type, create one line in this configuration file. This line must include two required 
//fields separated by a comma (no spaces before or after the comma), followed by an optional third field. 
//Each line in the configuration file should look like:
//<device name>,<list of names of primary parameters whose names and values you would like to keep in the sanitized netlist>  <optional: the new name for this device, surrounded by #s>
//where
//	<device name> is the name of the device, 
//	<list of names of primary parameters whose names and values you would like to keep in the sanitized netlist> 
//  is the list of names of primary parameters separated by spaces, and
//	<optional: the new name for this device, surrounded by #s> is the name you wish to use for this device in the sanitized netlist (more ahead). 
//For example, if the following line appears in the configuration file, then the sanitizer will change the 
//name of every device called nfet in the original netlist file to nmos in the sanitized netlist file. Further, 
//for every device called nfet in the original netlist file, all associated parameter names and values, except 
//for parameters with names w and l,  will be removed from the sanitized netlist file. 
//	nfet,w l #nmos#  
//Such renaming of device names is necessary to protect the foundry-proprietary information from being 
//widely distributed with the netlist. The user may choose the new names to match those in a predictive 
//open-source technology (e.g., nmos and pmos for transistors). Alternatively, the user may choose a set 
//of generic names with one-to-one mapping (e.g., nmos1, nmos2, etc., for different specific types of 
//nMOS transistors; and C1, C2, etc., for different specific types of capacitors). One-to-one mapping of 
//names will allow de-santization, but would require sharing of the one-to-one mapping table via a 
//foundry-authorized channel.
//If the optional third field is not included at the end of the line, then the device name will not be 
//changed. For example, if the following line appears in the configuration file, then the sanitizer will work 
//exactly as in the above case except that it will NOT change the name of the device nfet.
//	nfet,w l
//Additional notes:
//1) The configuration file should not have any empty lines. (We will fix this soon.) However, it can have 
//any number of comment lines, where each comment line starts with //. 
//2) Unless you have the explicit permission from the foundry, it is best to replace the original device 
//names with generic names. 
//3) Unless you have the explicit permission from the foundry, it is best to keep your sanitizer 
//configuration file private.
//4) Lines in the configuration file corresponding to different device names with similar starting/ending 
//substrings may be combined using wildcard (*). However, this works only if all these devices have 
//identical lists of parameter names/values that you would like to keep in the sanitized netlist. 
//For example, the following two lines in the configuration file
//nfet,w l
//pfet,w l
//can be combined into one line, as:
//	*fet,w l
//However, two lines 
//nfet,w l #nmos#  
//pfet,w l #pmos# 
//cannot be combined, since these two device names are being renamed differently.
