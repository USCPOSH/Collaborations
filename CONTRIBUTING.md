# Contributing

This public repository is open to any and all POSH performers collaborating with USC.

Development of the following tools (with links to their corresponding repositories) is encouraged, provided USC is credited:
1) AMPSE: <https://github.com/USCPOSH/AMPSE>
2) Sanitizer: <https://github.com/USCPOSH/Sanitizer>
3) PDK swapper and SQP local optimizer: <https://github.com/USCPOSH/Local-optimizer>

Create a directory named after your institution (e.g., University of Southern California --> "USC") and upload any/all collaborative files (e.g., netlists, powerpoint slides, etc.) into that directory.
